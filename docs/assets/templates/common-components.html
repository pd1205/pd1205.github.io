<h1>Using Javascript for low level Common Components</h1>
<p>
    We shoud be developing low level common components in vanilla Javascript, instead of creating a version for every popular framwork, which we may be using.
    From back when JQuery was the industry standard, to Angular, Vue or React which are popular today, We have seen many frameworks and libraries come and go.
    As an Enterprise, It makes little sense to limit low level common components to a single framework or incur costs to scale to the popular framewroks of the time, expecially when they keep changing.
    Rather, If there exisits one common components library which is made available for all the organizations/Business units of the enterprise. We would see substantial saving in the long term.
